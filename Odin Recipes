The Odin Project has taught me a series of skills essential to learn web developing. These include the core concepts of what are web pages and how they work, basic operations on the command line, using a text editor, Git basics, and an introduction to HTML. 

Command line can be used for navigating, creating, transferring, deleting, and listing files. 

HTML is a core language that can be used to setup  webpage from the backend.
