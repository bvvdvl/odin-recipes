    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
       <ul>
        <li> 1 ¼ cup Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li> 6 tbsp butter </li>
        <li> 1 garlic clove </li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
        <li> ¼ tbsp pepper </li>
        <li> 1 lb Fettucine pasta </li>
       </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. </li>
            <li> Add salt to season the water.</li> 
            <li> Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
            <li> In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li> Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Stir in heavy cream and let it reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.</li>
